# Loan Risk Analysis 

#Description: This project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle that shows various factors that led to a loan approval/rejection. We are using this dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a machine learning model in predicting loan approval. 

#Getting Started:
Please download this CSV file from Kaggle. It will be used to run the code. 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parthpatel2130/realistic-loan-approval-dataset-us-and-canada?resource=download  

Optionally, this CSV is also available in the repository.

#Running The Code:
The repository contains a file called 'Test' which contains the code for the model. 

To run the code, open the 'Test' file in Google Colab. 

Then upload the dataset. There are two options:
1. Upload CSV manually
2. Save CSV file in Google Drive. Mount google drive to access file directly.

Run the code to display the data and results.
